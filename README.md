# DocsGPT

While OpenAI's ChatGPT is an extraordinary innovation, we can now also use OpenAI to query our own documents.

This is a very early demo app that uses OpenAI's GPT and [ðŸ¦œðŸ”—LangChain](https://langchain.com) to process and chat with your local PDF files.

It comes preloaded with sample Amazon annual and shareholder reports in a ./files/ subfolder. You can start chatting with those or replace the files in the subfolder with your own PDFs

Load it onto your laptop and start asking the PDFs questions.  OpenAI's GPT 3.5-turbo analyzes and provides answers. See the demo screenshots below.


## Screenshots

[2023-04-19] This screenshot shows the Q&A after the PDFs are ingested. Each question is queried to the GPT 3.5-turbo API and the response is generated in real-time.
